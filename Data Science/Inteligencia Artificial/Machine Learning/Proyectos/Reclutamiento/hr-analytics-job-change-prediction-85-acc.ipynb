Dubbed \"the sexiest job of the 21st century\" by Harvard Business Review and \"the best job in the US\" by Glassdoor, the data scientist's role is in high demand as organizations are in great demand. need experts who can organize incredible amounts of data.\n\nData science is attracting a growing number of professionals in a managerial or analytical role, especially those interested in directing their careers to the new digital age.\n\nA company in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among those who have successfully passed some of the courses conducted by the company or have had certain experience or some special background. So the question is, is it possible to predict whether an employee can change his/ her careers path? Especially in difficult times, economic crisis, job crisis or pandemic crisis like Covid-19 nowaday. What parameters that affect career switch decision?\n\nFrom a human resource management perspective, the company wants to know which of these candidates really want to work for the company or are looking for new jobs as it helps to reduce costs and time as well as the quality of training or planning for course and candidate classification. Important information may pertain to demographics, education, and experience on hand from registered and enrolled candidates.\n\nTherefore, this Notebook attempted to understand what factors that lead a person to work for the company or switch his/ her career path to Data Scientist. In the next step, different models using existing credentials / demographics / experience data to predict the probability of candidates looking for a new job or will work for the Company. This Notebook also synthesizes models that can be used to predict an employee's possibility to switch their careers to a \"data scientist\"?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Notebook outline:\n\n1.

Logistic Regression\n\nIt is a classification not a regression algorithm. It is used to estimate discrete values (Binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false) based on given set of independent variable(s). In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function. Hence, it is also known as logit regression. Since, it predicts the probability, its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).\n\nLogistic regression is a fundamental classification technique. It belongs to the group of linear classifiers and is somewhat similar to polynomial and linear regression. Logistic regression is fast and relatively uncomplicated, and it’s convenient for you to interpret the results.

Naive Bayes - Gaussian Naive Bayes\n\nIt is a classification technique based on Bayes’ theorem with an assumption of independence between predictors. In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, a naive Bayes classifier would consider all of these properties to independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple.\n\nNaive Bayesian model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.\n\nNaive Bayes models are a group of extremely fast and simple classification algorithms that are often suitable for very high-dimensional datasets. Because they are so fast and have so few tunable parameters, they end up being very useful as a quick-and-dirty baseline for a classification problem. That said, they have several advantages.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"title = \"GaussianNB/SMOTESVM\"\nModels(GaussianNB(),X_train3, X_test3, y_train3, y_test3, title)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# C. kNN (k- Nearest Neighbors)\n\nIt can be used for both classification and regression problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases by a majority vote of its k neighbors. The case being assigned to the class is most common amongst its K nearest neighbors measured by a distance function.\n\nK Nearest Neighbor(KNN) is a very simple, easy to understand, versatile and one of the topmost machine learning algorithms. KNN used in the variety of applications such as finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition and video recognition. In Credit ratings, financial institutes will predict the credit rating of customers. In loan disbursement, banking institutes will predict whether the loan is safe or risky. In political science, classifying potential voters in two classes will vote or won’t vote. KNN algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. KNN algorithm based on feature similarity approach.\n\nHowever, KNN is computationally expensive. Variables should be normalized else higher range variables can bias it. For better results, normalizing data on the same scale is highly recommended. Generally, the normalization range considered between 0 and 1. KNN is not suitable for the large dimensional data. In such cases, dimension needs to reduce to improve the performance.

Decision Tree\n\nThis is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. Surprisingly, it works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables. In this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. This is done based on most significant attributes/ independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible. \nA decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value. It partitions the tree in recursively manner call recursive partitioning. This flowchart-like structure helps you in decision making. It's visualization like a flowchart diagram which easily mimics the human level thinking. That is why decision trees are easy to understand and interpret.\n\nDecision Tree is a white box type of ML algorithm. It shares internal decision-making logic, which is not available in the black box type of algorithms such as Neural Network. Its training time is faster compared to the neural network algorithm. The time complexity of decision trees is a function of the number of records and number of attributes in the given data. The decision tree is a distribution-free or non-parametric method, which does not depend upon probability distribution assumptions.

The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest).\n\nRandom forest is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm based on ensemble learning. Ensemble learning is a type of learning where you join different types of algorithms or same algorithm multiple times to form a more powerful prediction model.

Even if a new data point is introduced in the dataset the overall algorithm is not affected much since new data may impact one tree, but it is very hard for it to impact all the trees. The random forest algorithm works well when you have both categorical and numerical features. The random forest algorithm also works well when data has missing values or it has not been scaled well.\n\nHowever, a major disadvantage of random forests lies in their complexity.
