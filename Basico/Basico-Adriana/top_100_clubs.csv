1,Hï Ibiza,"Ibiza, Spain","5,692",hiibiza.com,"What makes a great club? Show-stopping line-ups plucking from the most exciting talent of the day, mixing big-room headliners and emerging names? Pin-point-perfect audio in every corner? What about mind-blowing lighting to transport crowds into the stratosphere? And a labyrinthine layout hiding weird and wonderful elements in which to get lost, or find a pack of new friends. Maybe, it’s all of the above. First opening doors onto Ibiza’s legendary Playa d’en Bossa strip in 2017, Hï Ibiza’s inaugural two seasons catapulted the address toward the pinnacle of DJ Mag’s Top 100 Clubs poll. For the past three years, the venue has stood at the summit of this annual list. A non-mover now ranking at No. 1 so consistently it’s getting harder and harder to work out what hasn’t already been said about the fabled institute. World’s most technologically advanced dance music destination: check. Home to the White Isle’s premier-league residencies: done. A marvel of nightlife design: read it before. Any attempt to define why Hï Ibiza continues to prove so perennially popular should probably start by talking about the layout. Take the Theatre, for example. A main room inspired by Italian amphitheatres with a VIP terrace surrounding the dancefloor, here, a huge LED screen creates a fully immersive experience as sonic drama blasts from the powerhouse L-Acoustics rig. One of the finest sounding things we’ve been lucky enough to experience, lasers, confetti cannons, and CO2 jets heighten the impact of every drop, breakdown and rolling drum those speakers emit. In contrast, the Club Room feels squarely aimed at the heads — a darker, smaller, lower-ceilinged enclave where the DJ booth sits at eye level and there are far less distractions. A venue within the venue focusing firmly on the music, effects are used to emphasise and accentuate, rather than create awe-inspiring visual spectaculars.For many, though, The Wild Corner is actually Hï Ibiza’s hidden highlight, a unisex bathroom with CDJs, mixer and a ceiling illuminated in vivid colours. It’s serious yet fun, or maybe that should just be seriously fun.Back outside, The Magic Garden and Secret Garden provide respite from the chaos, places to kick back, relax and talk nonsense to anyone who will listen. Ethereal installations and luxurious teepees set the tone for these chillout oases.Each of these areas will make a huge impression in their own right, but arguably it’s the way every element of the complex can be fine-tuned to suit any event that guarantees so many returning visitors. Whatever the night, whoever is playing, things will look distinct compared to 24 hours earlier.“Our goal is always to create the best experience possible. We put our heart and soul into making every aspect of our events special, but the key element has and always will always be our guests. Without their continued support none of this would be possible. Taking the No. 1 spot in the DJ Mag Top 100 Clubs poll was a dream from the beginning, so to have been awarded the accolade for three years in a row feels incredible,”  says Yann Pissenem, founder, CEO and owner of Ushuaïa Entertainment, Ushuaïa Ibiza and Hï Ibiza. “Alongside our incredible family of headline residents, and world-first debuts from pioneering artists, this year clubbers will be able to explore the multi-room experience like never before as we embrace new technologies and showcase cutting-edge production, ensuring Ibiza’s legacy as one of the top clubbing destinations in the world.”So, what does that really mean for the standard bearer? 2024 will be the venue’s longest season to date, although in many ways much is the same. Hï Ibiza remains shorthand for a one-of-a-kind 360 nightlife experience unlike anything else on the island. It still means expertly programmed sessions led by extraordinary selectors, graced by groundbreaking guests. Impromptu back-to-back sets will continue to bring unforgettable surprises. And the beloved sessions and artists who call this place home are back, for good reason. Like Black Coffee and his sell-out soirée, and Afterlife, where Tale of Us’ melodic grooves form ethereal moments heightened by breathtaking imagery.David Guetta & MORTEN’s aptly-named Future Rave is also here again, marrying main stage tunes and warehouse noises with surrealist eye-candy. Glitterbox’s colourful, unabashed celebration of upfront house and disco is another contrast. Meanwhile, Eric Prydz will present a newly updated take on his legendary A/V displays, this time known as [CELL]. Whichever you hit — The Martinez Brothers or FISHER — the venue will be transformed for and by the occasion in ways that would prove impossible without Hï Ibiza’s benchmark-setting specifications. And that’s just in the Theatre; head to the Club Room this summer and the likes of Patrick Topping, Paco Osuna, Vintage Culture, Damian Lazarus, and Meduza & James Hype will be leading sonic journeys of their own.So, what are we looking for in a great club? Beyond the obvious, perhaps adaptability and versatility are the key ingredients. An environment made for events that could only happen in there, at that moment. And a place that’s always ready to do it all over again, only different, tomorrow night.

2,Green Valley,"Camboriú, Brazil","10,000",greenvalleybr.com,"Green Valley continues to bounce back better since it was shuttered in 2020 by a double whammy of disasters. Not only was it forced to close, alongside virtually every other club in the world, by the Covid pandemic, but a few months later it was pretty much totally destroyed by a freak cyclone. The club has now been completely rebuilt and returns to the No. 2 spot this year.The beautiful Brazilian club started out simply as a party in the jungle. Some electronic dance music fans wanted to put on a big rave in 2007, and booked none other than Carl Cox to headline in a makeshift tent on an old airfield in the heart of the huge South American country. When this event was a spectacular success, they started booking other international DJs and growing some infrastructure to begin making it into a permanent venue. Three years later it had shot into the Top 100 Clubs poll at No. 27, and by 2013 it had been voted the No. 1 club in the world! It’s remained consistently popular globally, being voted into the top three every year since 2011 — an amazing achievement.In the past 12 months, Green Valley has continued to transform itself internally, tweaking the layout and air-con and redesigning the VIP and backstage areas. The main stage has undergone modifications to bring performers closer to the audience in order to foster closer connections between artists and fans, and a more immersive screen has also been added in order to enhance visual effects.The club offers a sublime mixture of musical attractions. In terms of the talent, Green Valley has continued to book everyone from the biggest names to underground heroes and local sensations. In the last 12 months these have included: Peggy Gou, Duke Dumont, Meduza, Eli & Fur, Vintage Culture, ANNA, Claptone, CamelPhat, Layla Benitez, Boris Brejcha, Yotto, Tale Of Us, WhoMadeWho, Adriatique, ARTBAT, Eric Prydz and Cristoph, to name just a few.“As Green Valley continues to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of electronic music and nightlife, one thing remains constant — its unwavering commitment to providing exceptional experiences for its customers,” says Antonio Afonso, International Managing Director of Green Valley. “With its blend of stunning natural surroundings, cutting-edge technology and world-class talent, GV stands as a beacon of innovation and creativity in the global dance music scene.” The beautiful Brazilian club started out simply as a party in the jungle.

3,Echostage,"Washington, DC, USA","3,000",echostage.com,"Based in the capital of the United States, Echostage ranks among the country’s most dazzling dance venues. A former Top 100 Clubs No. 1 — the first North American club to claim the top spot — it’s been in operation for 12 years, and the giant event space continues to evolve and innovate. In recent months, Echostage has had another refurb, with 130 new lighting fixtures, 56 precision beam fixtures, eight laser units, and 30 dynamic strobe fixtures, with the aim to evoke festival levels of production in an indoor space.The club sits on the site of two older venues, DC Tunnel and DC Star. Opened in 2012, it’s a sprawling, 30,000-square-foot warehouse-like space, equipped with confetti cannon, lasers, cryo-jets and a 14-by-40-foot LED screen. VIPs can take advantage of its mezzanine area and bottle service tables, and there’s an d&b Audiotechnik V-Series sound system with D80 amplifiers — the first of its kind to be installed on America’s East Coast — capable of delivering 48,000 watts of sound.In the last year, Echostage booked many of the biggest dance acts across the genre spectrum, including Tale Of Us, GRiZ, Gryffin, Charlotte de Witte, Netsky, Pendulum, The Martinez Brothers, SVDDEN DEATH, Marshmello and Black Coffee, as well as hosting the first-ever Boiler Room DC. Previous appearances at the venue include Tiësto, FISHER and Timmy Trumpet, but the club is not only a magnet for prestige dance acts: pop and hip-hop royalty like Lil Yachty, Cardi B, Sam Smith, Lorde and Miley Cyrus have dropped in to grace its huge stage.Though less well-known for its dance music history than other American cities like Chicago, Detroit and New York, Washington, DC has its own bubbling scene that has given rise to everyone from Deep Dish and Beautiful Swimmers to the Black Rave Culture crew. Echostage is another vital part of the puzzle that has put the US capital on the map for clubbers.Echostage runs pre- and post-event parties for its own massive Project GLOW Festival that takes place each April in the city’s RFK Grounds, and runs Halloween-themed events in October. At the end of December each year, the club hosts Echothon, a week-long event series in the run-up to New Year’s Eve, inviting some of the biggest DJs to spark the festive atmosphere. This summer, the club will stage the debut elrow DC event in Washington, and an impressive billing of artists is already locked in for autumn.

Across four floors, Bootshaus is a veritable playground for electronic music, with each room cultivating a distinct vibe and aesthetic — and with a sound system to match. Whether you are spending time in BLCKBX, the club's renowned bass sanctuary, or getting hypnotised by the custom-made L-Acoustics sound system in the biggest space, Mainfloor, each of the rooms is designed for an immersive clubbing experience.This diversity of layout is matched by the distinct programming of the club. Bootshaus has grown alongside a number of Cologne's key musical brands, handing the reins over to local powerhouses like Blacklist, Nibirii and Unreal, who each curate distinct parties — from Nibirii's impeccable psychedelic take on trance to Blacklist’s masterclasses in the dark art of bass weight. These partnerships have also led to esteemed residencies at the club. Alongside Bootshaus' own resident roster, helmed by Brandon, Dave Replay, Emin, Isis Cloudt, Kevin Arnold, and Oliver Magenta, Blacklist has introduced Autodrive, Badfella, Flobu, Makla, and Sekula to the club, and Nibirii brings in Gourski and LYNE.

In 2019, it settled into the former railway yard and Royal Mail distribution centre that is Depot Mayfield, renovating it into the mammoth multi-purpose venue that it is now. The space has kept its raw, industrial feel, with exposed bricks, concrete floors, and vast iron framework. Last season alone, WHP had the likes of Bicep, Four Tet, Leftfield, Peggy Gou, Yung Singh and Honey Dijon come through, with a star-studded list of resident DJs on rotation that include I. JORDAN, Interplanetary Criminal, Effy and Aletha. Spring this year will see the launch of a new series called ARCHIVE ONLY, where artists such as Daphni, Girls Don’t Sync and East End Dubs will play in the intimate setting of the Archive room on Thursdays. The full 2024 season will return from September until New Year’s Eve; the line-ups are yet to be revealed, but expect many new club debuts as well as the return of beloved collaborators and curators.

A staple (and previous winner) of the Top 100 Clubs poll, 2024 sees the club reclaim its place in the top 10, and it’s no surprise after a year when everyone seemed to be talking about fabric. The last 12 months saw a redesign of the iconic main entrance, and the opening of a new shop selling pizza, soft drinks, music and merch. Bookings, as always, included the cream of the underground, alongside residents Craig Richards, Terry Francis, Anna Wall, Bobby., Harry McCanna, Hutch, Jaden Thompson and Josh Caffé. The fabric, FABRICLIVE and Continuum events have been joined by new Sunday series C.A.Y.A. (Come As You Are), and Love Hertz, which launched with a show at St. Paul’s Cathedral. But the big focus now is the 25th anniversary year, with the past, present and future of fabric coming together via the Invites series, where long-term collaborators are given the chance to curate club nights, a run of takeovers at other clubs like Fuse, Tresor and Lux Fragil, and six events curated by Craig Richards.

Despite its relative distance to the main action, the island’s original superclub continues to pull more than its weight. From its early days as a countercultural haven and then hub for Balearic pioneers, to its shift as a global player with the explosion of rave culture, the club has outlived many of its peers, continuing to pull in new generations of talent. Carl Cox, Sven Väth, Chase & Status and Skrillex have all spun in one of its two rooms, while Underworld, Public Enemy and 50 Cent have performed live on its stages. It also remains a key attraction for well-known faces — Naomi Campbell, Cristiano Ronaldo and Leonardo DiCaprio have been spotted at the iconic location. But it’s the club’s attention to detail, from its residency programming to party curation, that’s kept it relevant to new waves of electronic music lovers. This year's opening party includes sets from top-tier DJs such as Dennis Cruz, Green Velvet, Honey Dijon and Nina Kraviz. Jamie Jones will continue to host his Paradise series there too — not to mention the legendary Do Not Sleep and elrow parties.

Often this has been through the venue’s own curated Law Of The Jungle series, but brands such elrow have also been queuing up to host their own events. “We're thankful to the people of Bali for their warmth and vibrant culture, which inspire our team to deliver unforgettable experiences at Sayava,” founder Alex Cordova says. “Bali is evolving from a tropical paradise into a global music destination.
